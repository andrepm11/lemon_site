            What’s in a Verb Bar?
          </span>
          <span class="q-answer visible">
            Verb bars are made with almond butter, rolled oats, puffed brown rice, organic unsweetened cocoa powder, vanilla, and caffeine from organic green tea, then lightly sweetened with organic agave nectar and a hint of brown sugar. The bars are made in a certified gluten-free facility.

            Where can I get a Verb Bar?

            How does the amount of caffeine in a Verb Bar compare to suggested amounts?
          </span>
          <span class="q-answer closed">
            The FDA recommends up to 400mg of caffeine per day. Each Verb Bar has 100mg of caffeine, the same amount as a cup of coffee.

            Why do you use caffeine from green tea in Verb Bars?
          </span>
          <span class="q-answer closed">
            We’ve chosen organic green tea because it’s healthy, clean, and provides a long-lasting energy boost. Caffeine from tea is absorbed over a longer period of time than that from other sources. That’s why coffee drinkers usually report feeling more focused and energized after a Verb Bar than after coffee.

            What’s a Verb subscription?
          </span>
          <span class="q-answer closed">
            Many of our customers were having one or more Verb Bars each day, so we decided to offer a subscription service. You decide how many boxes you want each month, and we mail them to your door so you don’t have to worry about interrupting your routine. You can cancel at anytime. Get started <a href="#OrderVerb">here</a>.
